# Interval Scheduling
Note: this reposotry include other codes for algorithms such as merge sort 
## Purpose
<!--Purpose of the project-->
This poject is a nterval scheduling program. The purpose of this project is to find the non overlapping intervals from a file that contains a list of intervals with start and end time.

## Description
Upon executing the program the user will be prompted to enter the name of his text file containing the list of time intervals. The program will print to the user the current number of intervals it will then print the maximum number of non overlaping intervals. If the file does not exits the user will be notified. The program will also run as lon as the yser has some schedule he wishes to fix.

## Built With
* Python

<!--Header 3 installation and launching the project-->
## How to run the program
* Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/AichaSidiya/AlgorithmAnalysis.git
``` 
* Install [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Verify python is insalled by typing
```
python
```   
in your command prompt
* Execute the program using: 

```
